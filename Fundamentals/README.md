## Key Features

<ol>
  <li>All the data is <h1> cryptographically hashed </h1> using public private key infrastructure.</li>
</ol>  

1. 
2. Every Block is <h1> time-stamped and chronologically linked </h1>.
3. The data is immutable.
4. Merkle Roots and Previous hash can be used to search the data in any block.
5. Blockchain is peer to peer network where computer/devices having the right software can interact with each other.
